# R-Shiny Data Exploration

This project was created in the scope of the InsideDEM project (http://insidedem.de/) at the University of Rostock and was supported by a grant from the Federal Ministry of Research (BMBF) [grant 16SV7348K].
The work was supervised and executed at the Mobile Multimedia Information Systems (MMIS) chair at the University of Rostock (https://www.mmis.informatik.uni-rostock.de/) as part of a student project focusing on newest developments in computer science (the so called NEidI project is mandatory part of a master course in computer science at the University of Rostock).
